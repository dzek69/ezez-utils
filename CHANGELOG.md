## [UNRELEASED]
- (nothing yet)

## [4.5.0] - 2025-05-08
### Added
- `serializeToBuffer` method
- `unserializeFromBuffer` method (aliased as `deserializeFromBuffer`)
- `unserialize` alias to `deserialize` method
### Fixed
- `serialize` JSDoc mentioned custom serializer limitation with values with `.toJSON` method that was fixed in 4.0.0

## [4.4.0] - 2025-03-23
### Added
- `sortByMultiple` method
### Dev
- fixed `race` JSDoc

## [4.3.0] - 2025-03-04
### Added
- `race` method

## [4.2.0] - 2025-03-04
### Added
- `retry` method

## [4.1.0] - 2024-05-31
### Fixed
- `sample` adds `undefined` to the result type unless the input is a tuple
- `merge` return type was a basic intersection, which is not a correct way to represent merging
- `waitFor` will reject but call the callback indefinitely if timeout is set without `maxRetries`
### Added
- `memoize` method
### Changed
- every regexp now uses `u` flag, which could positively affect these functions: escapeRegExp, formatDate and isNumericString
- small docs improvements

## [4.0.0] - 2024-05-16
### Breaking
- `replaceDeep` will not mutate anything by default anymore — previously it was wrongly documented as always mutating,
but it was not mutating objects. Mutating behavior can now be enabled and additionally controlled by defining if
instances properties are allowed to be mutated.
- [`serialize`] to avoid excessive calls to serializer functions - they are now only called with non-plain objects or
unknown data types, this breaks some rare use cases
### Changed
- `serialize` custom serializers now allow things like `Date` (that defines .toJSON) to be supported as the user would
expect
### Added
- `replaceDeepByFn` method for more granular control over replacing values. `replaceDeep` is a simplified wrapper over
the new function
- `trim`, `trimStart`, and `trimEnd` methods
### Dev
- upgraded some jsdocs

## [3.0.0] - 2024-03-25
### Breaking
- `waitFor` method was upgraded:
  - now it supports Promises
  - the check fails only if `undefined`, `null` or `false` is given
  - function signature is changed (object options)
  - `maxTries` option is added to have a limit of tries unrelated to time
  - no wait before the initial check
### Added
- `toggle` method
- `sample` method
- `samples` method
- `shuffle` method
### Dev
- added `waitFor` unit tests
- added missing build files to repo (missing since 2.0.0)

## [2.1.0] - 2023-10-29
### Added
- `round` method

## [2.0.0] - 2023-10-09
### Breaking
- code is compiled to es2020 due to `bigint` usage, if you are not using `serialize` or `deserialize` you can still
transpile this lib yourself
### Added
- `serialize` method
- `deserialize` method
- `replaceDeep` method
